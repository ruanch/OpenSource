     1. Do performRoute when the source was dealloced or removed from view hierarchy.
     
     2. Do performOnDestination but the destination can perform the route type.
     
     3. Do removeRoute but the destination was poped/dismissed/removed/dealloced.
     
     4. Do removeRoute when a router is not performed yet.
     
     5. Do removeRoute when real routeType is not supported.
